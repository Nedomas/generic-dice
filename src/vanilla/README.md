# Vanilla JS source code of generic-dice

This directory contains the source code of the "Vanilla" Javascript version of generic-dice.

"Vanilla" here means plain Javascript, without any third party library or dependency used at runtime.

Third party libraries are still used during development and in the build process, but when the generic-dice code is used, only plain Javascript is required.
